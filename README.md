Imagine someone hopeless, sad and who have a lot of problems (interior and exteriors), thats me!
Yeah, that looks like some 'sad boy zoomer' talking, but thats the truth....
Soo, let me show you my coding hystory(sorry for the bad english(i'm to lazy to translate on google too))... In 2018, i started the high school with IT tecnichian, i did not like it, i used to do nothing at the classes and not paying attention, i got fxcked at the first year, the second too, i was like 'this is not for me, i want a career in the health area or biology, but in the third year, when the covid came and we got online classes, a friend of mine started to talk about the developer career and these programmer stuff etc etc. and i liked it!
I started studying by myself at my home, i did not give a fxck to school, just doing the basics to get the minimal grade, i started learning html and css... ohh, i remember spending all day on w3schools learning and doing some layouts...
Then when i finished the essential about html and css, i went to javascript, then node js with the frameworks and etc. Then... im here now, idk what to learn, WHY to learn... just stuck, and now my life has changed a lot and i dont feel need to keep studying... idk im just in need for someone to talk with and spend some time, this early-adult life is very complicated.
Btw, thats it, sorry for wasting your time, have a good one.
